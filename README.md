made with react and material-ui

### it uses a github repository to generate the skill tree
![skill tree](https://i.imgur.com/U2l4QS2.jpg)
this for example is generated from [this](https://github.com/0xCN/knowledge) github repository.

didn't make a custom material-ui's theme to do the colors because i was lazy.
